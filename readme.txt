Like Drupal Views but for WordPress, The Loops allows you to query the
database for content and display it in a page without having to write
php code.

== Description ==

The Loops plugin offers you great flexibility for displaying your site
content. It provides a graphical user interface in your WordPress site
admin that allows you to query the database for content without having
to write any PHP code or SQL queries.

With this plugin, you can display the queried content in a page or post
(using shortcodes) or a widget.

= Features =

* Query by post type
* Query by categories, tags or custom taxonomies
* Sort by ID, author, title, publication date, last modified date,
parent ID, number of comments, page order or randomly
* Display the loops anywhere with a shortcode
* Display the loops in a widget

** This plugin is in its earlier stages but stable and can be used in a
production environnement. Please be indulgent if it does not have some
features you need. **

For feature request and bug reports, [please use the
forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/the-loop?forum_id=10#postform).

If you are a plugin developer, [we would like to hear from
you](https://github.com/sorich87/the-loops). Any contribution would be
very welcome.

If you are a theme developer or designer, that's even better! [We would
like to hear from you](http://pubpoet.com/contact/) about how to make
the loops shine even more when displayed in your themes, or [any other
idea you have](http://pubpoet.com/contact/).

If you are a user and have a need that the plugin in its current state
doesn't cover, maybe you are willing to sponsorize the development of
some features... [then contact us!](http://pubpoet.com/contact/).
