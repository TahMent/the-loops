Like Drupal Views but for WordPress, The Loops allows you to query the
database for content and display it in a page without having to write
php code.

== Description ==

The Loops plugin offers you great flexibility for displaying your site
content. It provides a graphical user interface in your WordPress site
admin that allows you to query the database for content without having
to write any PHP code or SQL queries.

With this plugin, you can display the queried content in a page or post
(using shortcodes) or a widget.
